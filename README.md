## Introduction
For our first project, built a front-end for a Reddit-like application where a user, once logged in, can create a post that will show up on every userâ€™s feed and on which any user can comment.

Throughout this project we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and style pages, and to interact with the API.

## How to Use
You start at the index page and either enter your username and password if you are a returning user or you click the signup button where you are taken to a registration page to fill out the required information. then you are automatically shown to our content-page including the ability to make a make a blog post as well as add a comment or delete it on other posts.

## Technical Hurdles
Delete Post API request is non functioning.

## Approach Taken

In our first planning meeting, we discussed how we wanted to map our table relationships as it pertained to the overall database. Once we whiteboarded our ERD and split up what parts of the database each person would work on, we were able to start working on our respective sections. In addition to working on separate files, we created separate branches to organize our control flow.

Throughout the project we worked side by side so when problems arose we were able to research issues collectively and discuss solutions with one another to promote collaborative learning.

Our initial timeline for the project was as follows:

Day | Task
----| ----
Monday/Tuesday | Build out the back end using Intellij/Java/PostgresSQ
Wednesday | Testing and updating our front-end JavaScript files
Thursday | Testing the front-end and back-end of the website making sure there are no errors
Friday | Finishing touches


## Project Hurdles

We faced our biggest hurdle when we were linking our back-end to our front-end. While originally we thought that this part of the timeline would be the easiest, we found ourselves running into a recurring CORS issue which resulted in a temporary delay in progress.
