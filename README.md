Description
For our first project, we will be building a front-end for a Reddit-like application where a user, once logged in, can create a post that will show up on every user’s feed and on which any user can comment.

Throughout this project we will be using HTML and CSS, along with complex JavaScript to implement logic.

layout of the site implementing html foundations




















<!-- Technical Requirements
Students' apps must:

Have a landing page with a navigation bar.
Have user login and sign-up (i.e., create HTML forms).
Have a home page containing all posts.
Allow a user to create and delete their own posts.
Allow a user to view comments on other posts.
Allow a user to create and delete their own comments.
Allow a user to update their profile information.
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
Show user-friendly messages in case any errors occur.
Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Stick with the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles.
Include semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices).
You can create either a single-page app or multiple HTML pages. -->

<!-- Necessary Deliverables
A Git repository hosted on GitHub.
Around 50 (or more) commits on GitHub, dating back to the beginning of the project. (Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea of what you changed.)
A README.md file with:
Explanations of the technologies used.
A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
Installation instructions for any dependencies.
A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.
Stretch Goals
Create a responsive layout.
The user profile page shows the comments and posts from the logged-in user.
Error messages are handled gracefully either as modals or in-line with the HTML.
Use Adorable Avatars to generate random avatars for each user.
Allow the user to change their avatar on their profile page to any public image URL. -->
