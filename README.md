Description
For our first project, we will be building a front-end for a Reddit-like application where a user, once logged in, can create a post that will show up on every user’s feed and on which any user can comment.
Throughout this project we will be using HTML and CSS, along with complex JavaScript to implement logic.

Our first steps in starting this project was to layout design ideas in which we can execute our plan of a minimalist design while still having good user functionality. We decided to research ideas on how current social media sites implemented their designs and we wanted to have a similar outlook. We drew out the barebones HTML and CSS to be able to envision our design then started to implement the javascript. This was a long process, but through various attempt we were headstrong in achieving our goals.

Some hurdles we approached was including the comment section on our blog posts then also getting the delete comment section on our main content page. We also have a search functionality above our blog posts. Through various attempts we could not get this to work so we decided to just focus on the main content instead.  

Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript


Our day to day:


Monday September 9:
layout of the site implementing html foundations.
Tuesday September 10:
Added extra page for user to create profile now beginning to work
on the functionality of the site as well as the buttons.
Wednesday September 11:
Added User post functionality and Dom manipulation in order to have posts create with same
design as our original content page.
Thursday September 12:
created a comment button to add user input functionality to the main page then had comments posting and updated that to the Dom. Also fixed bugs within CSS homepage.

<!-- Technical Requirements
Students' apps must:

Have a landing page with a navigation bar.
Have user login and sign-up (i.e., create HTML forms).
Have a home page containing all posts.
Allow a user to create and delete their own posts.
Allow a user to view comments on other posts.

Show user-friendly messages in case any errors occur.
Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Stick with the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles.
Include semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices).
You can create either a single-page app or multiple HTML pages. -->

<!-- Necessary Deliverables
A Git repository hosted on GitHub.
Around 50 (or more) commits on GitHub, dating back to the beginning of the project. (Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea of what you changed.)
A README.md file with:
Explanations of the technologies used.
A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
Installation instructions for any dependencies.
A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.
Stretch Goals
Create a responsive layout.
The user profile page shows the comments and posts from the logged-in user.
Error messages are handled gracefully either as modals or in-line with the HTML.
Use Adorable Avatars to generate random avatars for each user.
Allow the user to change their avatar on their profile page to any public image URL. -->
