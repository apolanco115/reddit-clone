## Introduction
For our first project, built a front-end for a Reddit-like application where a user, once logged in, can create a post that will show up on every userâ€™s feed and on which any user can comment.

Throughout this project we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and style pages, and to interact with the API.

## How to Use
You start at the index page and either enter your username and password if you are a returning user or you click the signup button where you are taken to a registration page to fill out the required information then you are automatically shown to our content-page including the ability to make a make a blog post as well as add a comment or delete it on other posts.

## Technical Hurdles
Delete Post API request is non functioning.
