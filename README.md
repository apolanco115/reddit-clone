## Project Two

## Introduction

For the second project we were assigned the task of creating a fully functional back-end API to compliment the original front-end Reddit Clone project we had created earlier in the course. Our API allows users to signup, login, create/delete posts, create/delete comments and update their profile.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Postgres SQL


## Dependencies Used

Spring Initializer
https://start.spring.io

- Spring Web
- Rest Repositories
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgresSQL Driver
- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Data JDBC

## Approach Taken

In our initial planning meeting, we discussed how we wanted to map our table relationships as it pertained to the overall database. Once we whiteboarded our ERD and split up what parts of the database each person would work on, we were able to start working on our respective sections. In addition to working on separate files, we created separate branches to organize our work flow.

Throughout the project we worked side by side so when problems arose we were able to research issues collectively and discuss solutions with one another to promote collaborative learning.

Our initial timeline for the project was as follows:

Day | Task
----| ----
Monday/Tuesday | Build out the back end using Intellij/Java/PostgresSQL
Wednesday | Testing and updating our front-end JavaScript files
Thursday | Testing the front-end and back-end of the website making sure there are no errors
Friday | Finishing touches


## Project Hurdles

We faced our biggest hurdle when we were linking our back-end to our front-end. While originally we thought that this part of the timeline would be the easiest, we found ourselves running into a recurring CORS issue which resulted in a temporary delay in progress.
